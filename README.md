<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>Two movie datasets (20M and 0.1M datasets from grouplens.org) of combined size of more than 0.5GB are taken in this project for extracting several insights using different big data tools, namely PIG, Hive, Sqoop, Oozie, Spark (with Zeppelin notebook) and also for the execution of raw MapReduce programs, written in python. Also, a machine learning model using the collaborative filtering method[ALS algorithm] (in Spark MLlib) has been created to compare the accuracy of the predictions obtained from the two data sets. Furthermore, as an extension of the ML model, a recommender system has also been created to recommend movies to any user (that he or she has not seen yet from the movie database) based on the user's and other subscribers past watching habits. The recommender system has predicted pretty accurate genres and ratings (for the test user).</p>
